Let's fix `Alt/Option` key binding and use it along with some other keys to execute vim command. First of all we need to find what characters terminal is sending when `Alt` or `Option` key is pressed along with other key. To find that, execute the `cat` command and press Alt key along with other key you want. In this example, I am going to press the Alt along with right arrow `Alt + →`
```
~ $ cat
^[f
```
Pressing  `Alt + →` printed following `^[f` character in the terminal.
